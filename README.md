# E-commerce Consumer Behavior Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes consumer behavior in e-commerce using a Kaggle dataset to uncover trends and provide actionable insights for optimizing business strategies. The analysis focuses on purchase patterns, top-spending customers, preferred payment methods, and cross-selling opportunities.

## Key Insights
- **Peak Shopping Days:** Tuesday is the most active day for purchases, with a noticeable drop in activity on weekends.
- **Top-Spending Regions:** Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat lead in order volumes.
- **Preferred Payment Methods:** Credit cards and UPI are the most popular, with higher average order values.
- **Cross-Selling Opportunities:** Furniture & Decor, Bed, Bath & Table, and Health & Beauty are among the top product combinations frequently purchased together.

## Recommendations
- Focus marketing campaigns on peak shopping days and high-order regions.
- Promote preferred payment methods through discounts, installment services, and partnerships.
- Enhance customer experience on less active days (e.g., weekends) to boost sales.
- Leverage cross-selling opportunities by creating promotional bundles and improving product recommendation algorithms.
